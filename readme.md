ðŸ“Œ **Deprecation Notice**

This repository is deprecated and no more work will be done on this by OpenDialog. You can continue to use this and it should work as-is but any future issues will not be fixed by the OpenDialog community.

Date: 2022-11
Reason: DGraph was removed from all OpenDialog products as a dependency and as a result this repository is no longer maintained

Feel free to fork this repository and improve your fork. Existing forks are listed in [Network](../../network) and [Forks](../../network/members).

### Description

This is the official docker compose file for quickly deploying and spinning up a DGraph instance.

To run, first name sure you have installed docker and docker compose, then run:

```docker-compose up```

This will spin up DGraph Ratel on port 8000, DGraph Alpha on 8080 and DGraph Zero on 5080

All should be accessible through localhost
